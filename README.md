# Insight Box Prototype

## Project Overview
The Insight Box Prototype is a tool designed to analyze simulated journal entries for cognitive distortions. 

## Repository Structure

- **Insight_box_prototype.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the core code for data processing and analysis. It loads journal entries, applies the cognitive distortion detection algorithm, and generates insights.
- **simulated_journal.csv **: Example dataset with simulated journal entries. This serves as the input data for testing and demonstrating the prototype.
- **prototype_result.csv**: Output file containing the analysis results. It includes detected cognitive distortions and corresponding insights.
