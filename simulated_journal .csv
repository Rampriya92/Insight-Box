0,October 1st,"Started the month with a decent swim practice.  It felt good to be back in the water, a familiar comfort.  Classes are piling up though, and I already feel behind in Organic Chemistry. I hate the idea of a new month, of having to put in the work for another 30 days. Maybe I'm being overly dramatic, but the divorce is still so raw.  I miss how things used to be.  I talked to Mom tonight, which always helps. I feel calmer and a bit better after catching up with her.  I need to find that same peace in my studies."
1,October 2nd,"Completely bombed the chem quiz today.  I knew I wasn't prepared, but seeing that F staring back at me was still a punch in the gut. It feels like I am failing, but I need to study harder. I'm such a failure. Why can't I just be smart like everyone else in this class? I skipped tennis practice – what's the point? If I can't even manage a simple quiz, how can I hope to be good at anything? Spent the evening scrolling through Instagram, just feeling sorry for myself."
2,October 3rd,"Forced myself to go to the library today. Studied for a few hours, which is better than nothing. I'm still feeling down about the quiz, but I am trying to stop thinking about it. I did help this cute freshman with his math homework, which did my self-esteem a little good!  Maybe I can use this chem debacle as motivation. My old coach used to say, “fall down seven times, stand up eight.” I have to change that negative feeling into a positive and become a better student from this experience.  I ordered pizza and watched a movie with my roommate, which was a nice distraction."
3,October 4th,"Woke up feeling more positive. Went for a run, which always clears my head. I am very proud of myself for not skipping tennis practice, even though my ankle is still bothering me. My parents have been bickering non-stop lately. It is my fault that they hate each other now because of the problems that I have been having at school.  It's exhausting and makes me feel guilty even though I know it's not my fault.  Why can't they just get along for my sake? I need to find a way to block out their drama. I thought about going to the student counseling center, but I'm not sure."
4,October 5th,"Had a really good tennis practice.  I'm getting my serve back.  It felt amazing to just focus on the game and not think about school or my parents. I can't believe I almost quit earlier this week. I am happy that I did not quit playing tennis.  Evenings are hard though. I end up just lying in bed, staring at the ceiling and overthinking everything.  My mind races with every what-if. I feel so alone, even though I know I have friends and family who care."
5,October 6th,"Another productive day at the library. Starting to feel a little more on top of things.  Organic Chemistry is still a beast, but I’m chipping away at it.  I am actually surprised that I have understood the last 2 weeks of material. Maybe I’m not as dumb as I thought.  I called Dad tonight. It was a short conversation, but it was nice to hear his voice. He will never change, but I still love him. I wish I could talk to him, though, for real. Maybe after more time has passed, I can do so.  It will never be the same as it was before."
6,October 7th,"Slept through my alarm and missed my morning class. I am so angry with myself! I'm starting to feel like I'm losing control. Everything feels like an uphill battle. What's the point of even trying? I skipped swim practice.  I just didn't have the energy.  Stayed in my room all evening, feeling numb. I just watched some random videos online."
7,October 8th,"Had lunch with a friend from my English class.  It was good to laugh and talk about something other than school and family drama. She invited me to a party later this week, I don't know if I feel up to it, but maybe getting out would be good. I need to stop being such a hermit, but the thought of getting ready and socializing seems so draining.  I’m still behind on readings. I think I might be overwhelmed again."
8,October 9th,"Went to the party. I did enjoy myself once I got there, although I did not stay too long. It was nice to feel somewhat normal for a few hours.  I need to remember that there's a world outside of my own head. I felt myself retreating back into old habits in the middle of the party.  I almost left. I thought to myself: It is better that I go home now so that no one can ruin my mood. I am glad I did not leave.  I might try that again."
9,October 10th,Woke up with a headache and feeling exhausted. I regret going to the party and getting only 4 hours of sleep.  I'm so lazy. Why can't I just be more disciplined?  Skipped all my classes and just lay in bed all day. I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of apathy. This is the worst that I have felt in the last month. I need to snap out of this funk.
10,October 11th,"Dragged myself to the gym.  A little bit of exercise helped, even though I didn't feel like going initially.  Still feeling low, but I managed to get some studying done. Baby steps, I guess.  I made plans to study with a classmate tomorrow.  Hopefully, having someone to hold me accountable will help. I need to stop making plans for the future and focus on studying now! This will all turn into a big waste of time if I don't do the work."
11,October 12th,"Met with my classmate to study.  It was actually really helpful. I don't regret making plans with her.  We quizzed each other on the material, and I think I actually grasped some of the concepts I've been struggling with.  Having someone to study with makes a huge difference.  Maybe I should do this more often.  Still feeling tired, but I am less stressed about failing the class."
12,October 13th,Managed to get all my assignments done today! I'm surprised! I thought that I would fail the class and that there was no hope.  It feels like I’m slowly regaining some control.  I need to stop minimizing my accomplishments and give myself more credit. I actually celebrated by getting ice cream with my roommate. Little victories are still victories.
13,October 14th,"Went for a long walk around campus today. The fresh air and sunshine were good for my soul.  I felt like I could breathe again.  Evenings are still tough, but the days are starting to feel a little brighter. I saw a poster for a yoga class at the rec center. Maybe I should try that. Anything to help me relax."
14,October 15th,"Attended the yoga class. It was relaxing, although I don't know if I am completely on board with the spiritual side of things. Still, it was good to stretch and focus on my breathing. I noticed a weird muscle spasm in my ankle that was a bit worrisome. What if I have to stop tennis? How will I balance my life and my classes without it? This isn't the same as it was in high school. My entire identity would be ruined if I stopped playing tennis. I need to see a doctor, but I also want to avoid thinking that something is wrong with me."
15,October 16th,"Skipped class to go see the doctor about my ankle.  It's just a minor sprain, nothing serious, but I need to rest it for a few days.  It's frustrating, but at least it's not a major injury. I still have to worry about school, even with this injury. Nothing will stop me from finishing college. I am just a minor annoyance.  I picked up some comfort food on the way home. Sometimes mac and cheese is the best medicine."
16,October 17th,"Spent the day catching up on readings and studying.  Feeling productive, which is a nice change.  My ankle is still sore, but the pain is manageable.  I talked to Mom tonight.  She’s worried about me, which makes me feel loved, but also guilty for worrying her.  I need to find a balance between getting my life in order and keeping those close to me calm."
17,October 18th,"Had a really good study session with my classmate again. We’re starting to feel prepared for the upcoming midterm.  Feeling optimistic about my academic performance for the first time in weeks.  I also managed to get a good night’s sleep, which always makes a difference.  Small things like this make a big difference."
18,October 19th,"Another productive day of studying. I am starting to feel like my old self again.  I went for a swim after studying, and it felt great to be back in the water. I am making progress.  I can do this."
19,October 20th,"Woke up feeling anxious about the midterm.  I studied some more, trying to cram as much information as possible.  I know I’ve prepared, but I still have that nagging feeling that I’m going to fail. I need to stop being so pessimistic.  The midterm didn't feel so bad.  I'm hoping for the best."
20,October 21st,Got my midterm back…I passed!  I’m so relieved.  I actually did better than I expected. All that studying paid off.  I celebrated by going out for pizza with some friends.  It felt great to relax and enjoy myself.  I need to remember this feeling of accomplishment.
21,October 22nd,"Feeling burnt out after the midterm. I slept in late and skipped my afternoon classes. I’m starting to feel the pull of apathy again.  I know I shouldn’t skip class, but I just couldn’t bring myself to go. What's the point? I already passed the exam.  I feel guilty, but I also feel like I deserve a break."
22,October 23rd,"Forced myself to go to class. I just don't want to study. I'm still feeling unmotivated and tired. My parents are fighting again. They won't stop calling me about their arguments. I can't stand it.  It's like they don't even realize how much this is affecting me. I have to drop out of school because of this. I know it's only mid-semester, but I can't keep going like this."
23,October 24th,"Skipped all my classes again. I just stayed in bed, feeling numb.  I don’t even care anymore.  Why bother trying when everything just falls apart?  I'm starting to feel hopeless. I barely ate anything today. I don't even remember what I watched on TV, just something to distract myself.  I can’t shake this feeling of emptiness."
24,October 25th,"My roommate convinced me to go for a walk with her. It was nice to get out of my room, even if I didn't feel like it. I still feel like a failure. Everything seems pointless.  She tried to cheer me up, but nothing seems to help.  I just want to disappear.  I’m starting to scare myself."
25,October 26th,"Went to see the counselor at the student health center.  It was hard to talk about everything, but it felt like a small weight had been lifted. I don't even know if it helped, but I also know that I don't have enough time to keep attending these sessions. I cried through most of the session.  I made another appointment for next week.  Baby steps, I guess."
26,October 27th,"Still feeling low, but I managed to go to a few of my classes.  It’s hard to concentrate, but I’m trying. I feel like I don't even deserve help because of what I have been doing to myself. I don't know what I want. My parents won't stop arguing. My ankle has been bothering me. My classes are too difficult. I should just stop trying to avoid everything and just face it. I am trying to focus on putting one foot in front of the other."
27,October 28th,"Had another session with the counselor.  It helped a little, although I still feel lost and confused. We talked about coping mechanisms and ways to manage my anxiety. I'm trying to be more mindful of my negative thoughts.  I need to remember that things will get better, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now. I hate feeling like this, but this is who I am."
28,October 29th,"Went to swim practice, even though I didn't feel like it.  It felt good to be back in the water, even if I wasn’t at my best. I'm proud of myself for pushing through the apathy. I know my problems seem small compared to others', but I can still be kind to myself during this process.   Small victories."
29,October 30th,"Spent the day studying and catching up on missed assignments.  I still feel overwhelmed, but I’m making progress. I also signed up for another yoga class for tomorrow. I realized that I feel less anxious when I swim, play tennis, and do yoga, so I will continue attending those activities. I need to keep focusing on the positive and keep moving forward. One step at a time."
30,October 31st,"Went to yoga class. It was more relaxing than I expected. I am starting to look forward to this activity every week. I met a girl in the class who seemed nice. We talked about our majors and our favorite yoga poses. I think it's better than not doing anything productive. I am still feeling a bit down, but I'm trying to focus on the things I can control. I also booked a flight for thanksgiving next month to visit my parents separately. It will be the first time seeing them since the divorce.  I'm trying to find a balance in this new normal of their separate lives and mine."
